# Lists

For lists, we can have ordered and unordered lists.

```
1. One
2. Two
3. Three
```

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Let’s create an ordered list with sub-items.

```
1. First level
    1. Second level
        - Third level
            - Fourth level
2. First level
    1. Second level
3. First level
    1. Second level
```

1. First level
    1. Second level
        - Third level
            - Fourth level
2. First level
    1. Second level
3. First level
    1. Second level

To create an unordered list, we can asterisk, plus, or minus sign.

```
* 1
* 2
* 3

+ 1
+ 2
+ 3

- 1
- 2
- 3
```

* 1
* 2
* 3

+ 1
+ 2
+ 3

- 1
- 2
- 3

Let’s create an unordered list with sub-items.

```
- First level
    - Second level
        - Third level
            - Fourth level
- First level
    - Second level
- First level
    - Second level
```

- First level
    - Second level
        - Third level
            - Fourth level
- First level
    - Second level
- First level
    - Second level

We can also use HTML to create a list.

```
<ul>
<li>First item</li>
<li>Second item</li>
<li>Third item</li>
<li>Fourth item</li>
</ul>
```

<ul>
<li>First item</li>
<li>Second item</li>
<li>Third item</li>
<li>Fourth item</li>
</ul>

Let’s create a task list. We can create a task list using a hyphen followed by `[ ]`, and to mark a task complete, put an `x` inside the brackets.
