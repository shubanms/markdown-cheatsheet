# Syntax Highlighting

We can use a single backtick ``` ` ``` before and after the code block to create the following view.

```
A class method is an instance method of the class object. When a new class is created, an object of type `Class` is initialized and assigned to a global constant (Mobile in this case).
```

As you can see, the word `Class` is highlighted.

We can also use triple backticks ` ``` ` before and after the code block to create the following view.

```
public static String monthNames[] = {"January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"};
```

```java
public static String monthNames[] = {"January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"};
```
