# Links

We can create a link in four ways. The first one is by using an inline style. The second one uses reference style, the third one uses relative links, and finally auto links.

[The Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/shubanms/markdown-cheatsheet)

If you’re using the same link more than once, then using the reference style would be beneficial since you don’t have to write the link every time, and also, it’s easy to update the link. Moreover, you can use numbers for the reference text. Also, you can use the reference text as the link text.

We can also create relative links with all relative link operands, such as `./` and `../`.

GitHub can automatically create links from standard URLs.
