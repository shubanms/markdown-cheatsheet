# Mathematical expressions

You can now include diagrams using [mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/). You can read more on [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions). We can use `$` symbol to show inline and `$$` symbols to show math expressions as a block. Here is an example of an inline math expression:

```
This is an inline math expression $x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$
```

This is an inline math expression $x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$

Here is an example of math expression as a block:

```
$$
x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}
$$
```

$$
x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}
$$
